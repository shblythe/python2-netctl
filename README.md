python2-netctl
==============

This 'netctl' module attempts to provide a standard pythonic interface to
the systemd netctl networking control scripts.

It is a trivial interface to the command line tool.

Its only dependency is that the netctl program is available to run, however
since it depends on the text format of the tool not changing, it is worth
pointing out that the version developed against was netctl-1.7-1.
